# Product Requirements Document

# Momentum OS

## 1. Summary

Momentum OS is a post-launch growth and loyalty operating system for Bags coins.

It helps creators sustain momentum after launch by identifying real supporters, launching community campaigns, and rewarding the wallets that actively keep a coin alive.

The product is designed for the Bags hackathon with two goals:
- stand out strongly against the judging criteria
- be useful enough to grow into a real product after the hackathon

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Most coin products focus on launch.
Very few help creators after launch.

As a result, many coins experience:
- a short burst of attention
- temporary trading activity
- weak supporter retention
- no structured community loop
- no system for rewarding the people who actually sustain momentum

For creators, this means:
- no post-launch operating layer
- no easy way to understand or segment supporters
- no way to run structured growth or loyalty campaigns

For supporters and traders, this means:
- no recognition for early or loyal support
- no utility beyond price speculation
- no reason to stay active in the community

Momentum OS exists to solve this post-launch collapse.

---

## 3. Vision

Turn short-term launch hype into long-term community momentum.

Momentum OS should become the default post-launch layer for Bags coins by helping creators:
- understand who matters in their community
- create repeat engagement loops
- reward the supporters who keep the coin alive

---

## 4. Goals

### Primary Goals
- Create a clearly Bags-native post-launch product
- Help creators sustain community momentum after launch
- Give supporters reasons to return and stay engaged
- Demonstrate meaningful Bags API integration
- Align strongly with Bags hackathon judging criteria

### Secondary Goals
- Create a product with startup potential beyond the hackathon
- Build something demoable in under 2 minutes
- Support future fee-share and reward-routing extensions

---

## 5. Non-Goals

For v1, Momentum OS will not try to be:
- a launchpad
- a generic crypto analytics dashboard
- a generic social media marketing suite
- a full CRM platform for all crypto communities
- a multi-chain product
- a fully automated token distribution engine

---

## 6. Target Users

## 14. Bags Integration Requirements

Momentum OS must use Bags in a way that feels native and deep.

### Required Integration Themes
- coin and creator context from Bags-related surfaces

- Bags-specific logic in the workflow, not just branding

### Planned Bags API Usage
- token launch creator data
- token analytics / lifetime fees

### Principle
The product should feel impossible without Bags, not merely compatible with it.
